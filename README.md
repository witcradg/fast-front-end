# fast-front-end

This brainstorm was triggered by an article on bubble.io

There's an emerging project in my mind that is, in part, composed of pieces of technology I've been looking at as well as a goal not fully conceptualized.

Ultimately, it's about
- being able to implement websites very quickly (8 days? - confirm with Devin).
- part of this solution involves
	- a builder of some kind that I've been looking at.

	- a react library or personal component solution I've been looking at
	    I've actually been sort of doing this in a way. I used the components that I've created for codestaff.io, www.lanlinville.com, witcraft.io, chsforme.com. The next task would be to decompose the broad strokes I've been using into smaller components - something closer to real components.
        https://docs.bit.dev

        ```A real approach would involve picking a project and breaking down all the existing large components into smaller ones.```
	    
	- theme creation
	- possible ecommerce 
	- possible headless Wordpress CMS  
	
In a way I've been compiling ideas about this for a while now, but the discussion I had with Devin brought it to the forefront.
Devin would like to see me implement themes in a way that they could be sold.
Even if I never got that far along, the ability to have in my toolbox, technology I would use to move that direction would theoretically be of significant value if I start doing more sites.

I need to spend a bit of time fleshing it out and doing more research.

Starters are boilerplate projects that Gatsby developers can use to set up a new site quickly. Before creating a starter, it may be helpful to peruse the Gatsby Starter Library to see what already exists and determine how your starter will provide value.

#### Diary
Started working with bit.dev - The whole thing seems a bit convoluted to me. The process is not simple to create and reuse components and the whole thing seems to me like I might be just able to create a library of my components for reuse. HOWEVER... The idea of being able to pull off the shelf solutions to components created by others is simply TOO tempting and forces me to dig deeper.

I have started with the first Tutorial and had SOME progress, but some errors too. In the end I was able to get something saved, but the saved version was not viewable (errors) in the associated Playground. Currently working on the use of the component I created with the tutorial and adding it to a brand new create-react-app project.
